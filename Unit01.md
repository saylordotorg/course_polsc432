**Unit 1: An Introduction to Civil Liberties and Civil Rights** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This unit will serve as an introduction to the concept of civil
liberties and rights.  While these terms are commonly used
interchangeably, they actually refer to two related but quite different
things.  Civil liberties can be thought of, at least broadly, as
protections from government afforded to citizens through the
Constitution, while civil rights, can be thought of as protections of
citizens by government.  More specifically, civil liberties refers to
the protection of the individual's rights to form and express his or her
own preferences or convictions and to act freely upon them without undue
or intrusive interference by the government.  Civil rights centers more
specifically on the rights of citizens to participate freely and equally
in politics and participate in the electoral process. The reading for
this unit will rely heavily on a text along with other readings that
will explicate these differences. In this unit, you will define civil
liberties and rights, and in doing so, prepare yourself to read the
court opinions and interpretations of those opinions that will follow in
the other units. *

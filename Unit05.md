**Unit 5: Civil Liberties: Freedom of Religion** <span id="5"></span> 
*Much of the population of what would become the United States were
people fleeing religious persecution. As a result, explicit measures
were taken to provide for the protection of religious freedom from
government during the founding of the United States. This meant that not
only did the Constitution afford people the right to practice whatever
religion that they saw fit, but also that the government could not adopt
or promote any specific religion. There has been a tremendous amount of
controversy surrounding this topic throughout U.S. history. This
controversy contributed to varied interpretations of exactly what the
framers’ intended in creating measures to protect the freedom of
religion. This unit will include material that addresses the history of
both religious practice and religious freedom in this country, as well
as the current condition of religious freedom. In doing so, significant
court cases will be covered.*

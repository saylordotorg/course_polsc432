**Unit 4: Civil Liberties: Criminal Justice** <span id="4"></span> 
*As made clear in the previous units, the main source of citizens'
rights in America is the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the
Constitution. The Bill of Rights details the rights of the American
people and forbids the government to violate those rights. Clearly the
framers of the Constitution thought that protecting citizens from a
tyrannical criminal system was a priority, considering that four of the
amendments in the Bill of Rights pertain directly to criminal justice.
These amendments provide liberties that protect the procedural rights
that apply to citizens accused of a crime, defendants in criminal cases,
and those convicted of a crime.The material in the following unit will
cover the history of these liberties both in the context of the framing
of the Constitution and in their development in the courts across time.*

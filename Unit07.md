**Unit 7: Civil Rights: The Struggle for Gender Equality** <span
id="7"></span> 
*The Constitution did not directly provide civil rights for women. While
women were afforded civil liberties, they were not initially given the
most central civil right, the right to vote. The struggle for the right
to vote was not realized until 1919, a full 130 years after the
founding. The quest for gender equality did not end there. There are
many important legislative and judicial measures taken after women’s
suffrage seeking to end gender discrimination. This unit includes
material that will cover this historical struggle from multiple
perspectives. The material focuses on the social movement, the
legislation, and the prominent court cases.*

**Unit 6: Civil Rights: The Struggle for Racial Equality** <span
id="6"></span> 
Race has been at the center of politics in the United States since the
framing of the Constitution. The framers essentially had to table the
issue of slavery in order to get the Constitution ratified. This planted
the seeds that lead to the Civil War. Following the Civil War, the
struggle for racial equality continued coming to a head in the 1960s and
resulting in landmark legislation that changed African Americans’
struggle for civil rights. The struggle has continued in the court of
public opinion as well as in the judicial courts. This unit includes
material that will cover this historical struggle from multiple
perspectives. The material focuses on the social movement, the
legislation, and the prominent court cases.

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 16 hours to complete.

**Unit 2: Civil Liberties: Privacy** <span id="2"></span> 
*As noted in Unit 1, there is a distinction between civil liberties and
civil rights.  This distinction is, perhaps, no clearer than anywhere
else when we talk about the constitutionally protected “right” to
privacy.  Interestingly, privacy is often referred to as a right when it
is actually better characterized as a liberty. It is a constitutional
protection from government intrusion.  In its simplest terms, this means
the government cannot legally enter a citizen’s property or obtain
private communications without due process.  What constitutes due
process will be explored in this unit.  Additionally, this unit will
explore the historical development of privacy in the courts and the
reasons behind its initial inclusion into the constitution.  By the end
of this unit, you will understand the reasons why this liberty is
critical to a functioning democratic system. *
